# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 Algorithms on FCC. Continuing Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts**: I've been coding everyday for the past few weeks, so I feel even more encouraged that I can connect with others who are doing the same. 

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 Algorithms on FCC - "Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers" and "Sum All Primes."

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot about the reduce method and recursion.
