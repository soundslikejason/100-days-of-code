### Day 19: January 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Simon game - randomly animates with increasing rounds.

**Thoughts**: I think I can finish this project in the next day or two. I want that FCC Front-End Certification!!!

### Day 18: January 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to search and display data working with APIs.

**Thoughts**: Used Yahoo Weather API, OMDb API, packages, routes, templates...oh my.

### Day 17: January 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Patatap clone. Simon app has sound. Started learning about APIs.

**Thoughts**: Getting better each and every day. Small steps...consistency.

### Day 16: January 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Inital layout for Simon app with audio & animate upon click event. Express POST requests.

**Thoughts**: Can't wait to start building full, robust web apps. Today was a major step in routing GET/POST requests with Express.

### Day 15: January 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started Patatap clone. Express exercises.

**Thoughts**: Routing and EJS templates are make me feel so in control. It makes me think about the web in a whole new way. Also, getting my feet wet with canvas and a graphics framework. Two different worlds.

### Day 14: January 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple back-end using Node and Express. Worked on Simon app.

**Thoughts**: Gonna be balancing three focuses for the next few days - Simon app, Patatap app, and learning back-end tools.

### Day 13: January 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Tic Tac Toe app.

**Thoughts**: It can determine win, lose, or tie playing against the computer.

### Day 12: January 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Built a Todo List app. Continued working on Tic Tac Toe.

**Thoughts**: Todo List was good exposure to gradients and animation. Tic Tac Toe is a step toward AI.

### Day 11: January 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built a guess the RGB color game.

**Thoughts**: Used plain JS only, which was a departure from using convenience tools as of late.

### Day 10: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created the board for Tic Tac Toe. Looking at some new learning resources.

**Thoughts**: It's time to start looking at resources for back end dev.

### Day 9: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started Tic Tac Toe app. Completed 2 FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: Happy to have completed all the FCC Algorithms for the Front End Certification! Learned many JS methods in the process.

### Day 8: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pomodoro Clock app. Also learned some ES6 - arrow functions, template strings, and spread syntax. Completed 2 more FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: This is a type of app that I regularly use for work productivity.

### Day 7: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Pomodoro Clock visibly changes color and text status during transitions or when clicked. Completed 3 Algorithms on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Debating how minimalist I want the styling to be. Keeping it simple.

### Day 6: January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created working and break time transitions.

**Thoughts**: The main features are all there. Styling is next!

### Day 5: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Settings options to change length of time of clock.

**Thoughts**: Continued thoughts from Day 3...however, when the increment operator is used it will just concatenate the numbers. Have to use parseInt() function instead.

### Day 4: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I can click to start and reset Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts**: Everyday I open up the code editor and say to myself, "Let's create some magic." :sparkles: :joy:

### Day 3: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Countdown function in Pomodoro Clock works! 

**Thoughts**: Interesting how numbers are handled. A number as a string data type stored in a variable seems to be automatically parsed to a number data type when the decrement operator is performed on it.  

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 Algorithms on FCC - "Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers" and "Sum All Primes."

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot about the reduce method and recursion.

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 Algorithms on FCC. Continuing Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts**: I've been coding everyday for the past few weeks, so I feel even more encouraged that I can connect with others who are doing the same.
