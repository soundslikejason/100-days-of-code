# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 9: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started Tic Tac Toe app. Completed 2 FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: Happy to have completed all the FCC Algorithms for the Front End Certification! Learned many JS methods in the process.

### Day 8: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pomodoro Clock app. Also learned some ES6 - arrow functions, template strings, and spread syntax. Completed 2 more FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: This is a type of app that I regularly use for work productivity.

### Day 7: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Pomodoro Clock visibly changes color and text status during transitions or when clicked. Completed 3 Algorithms on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Debating how minimalist I want the styling to be. Keeping it simple.

### Day 6: January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created working and break time transitions.

**Thoughts**: The main features are all there. Styling is next!

### Day 5: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Settings options to change length of time of clock.

**Thoughts**: Continued thoughts from Day 3...however, when the increment operator is used it will just concatenate the numbers. Have to use parseInt() function instead.

### Day 4: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I can click to start and reset Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts**: Everyday I open up the code editor and say to myself, "Let's create some magic." :sparkles: :joy:

### Day 3: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Countdown function in Pomodoro Clock works! 

**Thoughts**: Interesting how numbers are handled. A number as a string data type stored in a variable seems to be automatically parsed to a number data type when the decrement operator is performed on it.  

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 Algorithms on FCC - "Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers" and "Sum All Primes."

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot about the reduce method and recursion.

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 Algorithms on FCC. Continuing Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts**: I've been coding everyday for the past few weeks, so I feel even more encouraged that I can connect with others who are doing the same.
